# PARKINSONS DISEASE PREDICTION FROM VOICE RECORDINGS
## Notebook of voice analysis for parkinson diagnosois

### Three different studies produced three different voice recording acoustic analysis metadata. The datasets from the three studies are analysed independently because the metrics collected on different systems are similar but not the same in that the signals are processed differently to get the independent variables analyzed.  
### Acoustic metrics of the healthy patients and Parkinson's patients at different stages are used to compare and contrast to generate a disease/healthy prediction. 
## Problem Statement
### Determine which Patients will have a Parkinson's disease diagnosis using metrics measured from 16 biomedical voice speech analytical signals. The outcome is Parkinson diagnosed score = 0, Healthy Patient score = 1 and or an physician evaluated UPDRS (Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale) parkinson spectrum ranking based on data collected over a 6 month period.
## Hypothesis
### Parkinson's Disease can be determined from considering acoustic patterns of voice recordings.
